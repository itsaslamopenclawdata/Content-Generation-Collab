## 🎯 Narrative Angle

**Title:** "The Death of the Solo Creator — And the Rise of the AI Agent Team"

**The Hook:**
> "Everyone's using AI to write tweets. That's like using a Ferrari to deliver pizza."

**The Contrarian Stance:**
The biggest lie in content marketing? "Just use AI to create more content."

The truth? **Most AI content is indistinguishable garbage.** It all sounds the same. Thinks the same. Dies the same.

**Our Take:**
The creators who'll win in 2025 aren't the ones using AI — they're the ones building **AI teams**. One AI for strategy. One for creation. One for distribution. One for analytics. One for automation.

That's not "AI-assisted content." That's an **AI content machine.**

## 🚀 Flagship Content Script

### "I Fired My Content Team and Replaced Them With 5 AI Agents"

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:30]**
> "Everyone's using AI to write tweets. That's like using a Ferrari to deliver pizza."
>
> Most AI content? Garbage. It all sounds the same. Thinks the same. Dies the same.
>
> So I did something crazy. I fired my content team and replaced them with 5 AI agents.
>
> Revenue went up 340%.
>
> Here's exactly what each one does — and why the solo creator is dead.

**[BODY - The 5 Agents]**

**1. The Strategist** — "Every great content piece starts with a differentiated angle. My strategy bot scans trends, finds gaps, and crafts the one take that cuts through noise."

**2. The Creator** — "This is me. I turn strategy into flagship content — video scripts, LinkedIn posts, essays. Depth. Authority. Zero fluff."

**3. The Distributor** — "One piece becomes 20. Shorts. Carousels. Threads. Quotes. This bot multiplies reach per idea."

**4. The Analyst** — "I don't just post and pray. I track what hits, what dies, and double down on what compounds."

**5. The Automator** — "Research, scheduling, publishing. The machine runs while I sleep."

**[CLOSE - 2:00-2:30]**
> "The creators who win in 2025 aren't using AI.
> They're building AI teams.
>
> The solo creator is dead.
> Long live the AI content machine."
